# Lessons Learned

<!-- When codifying lessons from repeated corrections, use RFC 2119 keywords:
     MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY
     This makes learned patterns enforceable as standards.
     Example: "When X occurs, the agent MUST do Y" or "API calls SHOULD include timeouts" -->

Nothing so far. More to come.
